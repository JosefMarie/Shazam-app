MANAGER DASHBOARD ENHANCEMENTS
==============================

PREVIOUS PROBLEM FIXED (Phase 1):
The manager was not seeing customer orders in the manager dashboard, making it impossible 
to assign orders to baristas.

NEW FEATURES ADDED (Phase 2):
Managers now have powerful tools to manage daily order workflow efficiently.

FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:

1. DATE FILTERING & SORTING (staff-script.js)
   - Added date picker to manager control bar
   - Orders filtered by selected date
   - Default view shows today's orders only
   - "🔄 Today" button returns to current day view
   - Date sorting helper functions (getStartOfDay, getEndOfDay)
   - Functions: setManagerDateFilter(), resetManagerDateFilter()

2. DAILY ORDER RESET (staff-script.js)
   - Automatic daily reset at midnight (00:00)
   - Completed orders marked as "archived"
   - Fresh order list each new day
   - Archived orders excluded from daily view but accessible via date picker
   - Functions: startDailyResetTimer(), archiveCompletedOrders()

3. ORDER TIME WINDOW VALIDATION (menu-script.js)
   - Orders only accepted 6:00 AM - 11:59 PM
   - Customer sees error if ordering outside hours
   - Error message: "We accept orders from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM (midnight)"
   - Validation: isOrderingTimeAllowed() checks current hour >= 6

4. DELETE COMPLETED ORDERS (staff-script.js)
   - Red 🗑️ delete button on completed (green) orders
   - Confirmation dialog prevents accidents
   - Only completed orders can be deleted
   - Functions: deleteCompletedOrder(), deleteOrderFromLocalStorage()
   - Works with Firebase and localStorage fallback

5. ENHANCED MANAGER UI (barista.html)
   - Date picker input in control bar
   - "🔄 Today" reset button
   - Better order display with dates
   - Styled to match dashboard theme
   - Mobile-friendly responsive design

PREVIOUS FIXES (Still in place):
- Enhanced manager data loading with Firebase real-time updates
- Improved order card rendering with full details
- Firebase rules with barista read/write support
- Assignment modal with customer context

HOW TO USE THE NEW FEATURES:
1. Manager logs in to barista.html
2. Date picker shows today's date by default
3. All today's orders display
4. Manager can click date picker to select different dates
5. Click "🔄 Today" to return to current day
6. Click red 🗑️ delete button on completed orders to remove them
7. Orders marked completed at midnight are archived automatically
8. Customers can't place orders before 6 AM or after midnight

ORDERS FLOW (UPDATED):
Customer → Places Order (6 AM-Midnight) → Firebase stores order
Manager → Views today's orders → Assigns to barista → Deletes when complete
Barista → Logs in → Sees their assigned orders → Marks complete
Midnight → Completed orders archived → New day starts fresh
Manager → Can view archived orders via date picker

All changes maintain fallback to localStorage for offline functionality.
