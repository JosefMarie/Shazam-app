BARISTA LOGIN FIX - SECURE AUTHENTICATION
==========================================

WHAT CHANGED:

Baristas can now ONLY login with names that were created by the Manager.
No more random login attempts with made-up names.

BARISTA LOGIN RULES:
✓ Username = Name created by manager in "Manage Baristas"
✓ Password = "barista" (fixed for all baristas)
✓ Keyword = "koffi" (fixed for all baristas)

EXAMPLE FLOW:

Step 1: Manager Creates Baristas
   - Login as Manager
   - Click "👨‍💼 Manage Baristas"
   - Add barista "Ahmed"
   - Add barista "Fatima"
   - Add barista "John"

Step 2: Barista Logs In
   - Go to barista.html or click "🔐 Barista Dashboard"
   - Click "👨‍💼 Barista"
   - Enter Name: "Ahmed"
   - Enter Password: "barista"
   - Enter Keyword: "koffi"
   - Click Login
   - ✓ Success! Sees only orders assigned to Ahmed

Step 3: Invalid Login (Won't Work)
   - Try Name: "Random Person"
   - Password: "barista"
   - Keyword: "koffi"
   - Error: "❌ Barista 'Random Person' not found. Use the name created by the manager."

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

1. validateBaristaLogin() function
   - Checks if barista name exists in Firebase database
   - Falls back to localStorage if Firebase unavailable
   - Validates against actual created baristas list

2. validateBaristaLoginLocalStorage() function
   - Alternative validation using browser storage
   - Shows helpful error message with available barista names (in console)

3. Error Messages
   - Clear guidance: "Use the name created by the manager"
   - Lists actual error in browser console for debugging

SECURITY FEATURES:
✓ Barista names must be pre-created by manager
✓ Password and keyword are fixed (no per-barista setup)
✓ Prevents unauthorized access
✓ Helpful error messages for legitimate baristas

LOGIN FORM IMPROVEMENTS:
✓ "👨‍💼 Barista Login" info box appears when selecting barista role
✓ Clear instructions: "Use your name as created by manager"
✓ Emojis for better UX: 👨‍💼 for name, 🔐 for password, 🔑 for keyword
✓ Helper text explaining validation

TESTING CHECKLIST:
☐ Manager creates 2-3 baristas with specific names
☐ Try logging in with correct barista name → SUCCESS
☐ Try logging in with wrong name → FAIL with helpful message
☐ Try wrong password → FAIL with password error
☐ Try wrong keyword → FAIL with keyword error
☐ Barista sees only their assigned orders

PASSWORD & KEYWORD REFERENCE:
Barista Password: barista
Barista Keyword: koffi

(These are the same for ALL baristas - manager sets them once)

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Q: Login says "Barista not found" but I created it
A: Check browser console (F12) - it shows available barista names
   Make sure the name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

Q: Can barista change their password?
A: No - all baristas use the same password/keyword set by manager
   Manager can create new credentials for all baristas if needed

Q: What if I forget my name?
A: Contact manager - they can see all created baristas in "Manage Baristas"
